      Halibut is a common name principally applied to the two flatfish in the
      genus Hippoglossus from the family of right-eye flounders. Halibut are
      demersal fish and are highly regarded as a food fish as well as a sport
      fish.The Pacific halibut is the world's largest flatfish.[5] The IGFA
      record was apparently broken off the waters of Norway in July 2013 by a
      515-pound 8.6-foot fish. This was awaiting certification as of 2013.[6] In
      July 2014, a 482-pound Pacific halibut was caught in Glacier Bay, Alaska;
      this is, however, discounted from records because the halibut was shot and
      harpooned before being hauled aboard.
