# Assessment 11: Data Structures and Algorithms

## Stacks

**Stacks**: _Stack is a **Linear Data Structure** which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be **LIFO**(Last In First Out) or **FILO**(First In Last Out). A real world stack allows operation at one end only. An example of Stack implementation is consider an example of plates stacked over one another in the canteen. The plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed, i.e. the plate which has been placed at the bottommost position remains in the stack for the longest period of time. So, it can be simply seen to follow **LIFO**(Last In First Out)/**FILO**(First In Last Out) order._
