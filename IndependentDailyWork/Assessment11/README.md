# Assessment 11: Data Structures and Algorithms

## Stacks

_Stack is a **Linear Data Structure** which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be **LIFO**(Last In First Out) or **FILO**(First In Last Out). A real world stack allows operation at one end only. An example of Stack implementation is consider an example of plates stacked over one another in the canteen. The plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed, i.e. the plate which has been placed at the bottommost position remains in the stack for the longest period of time. So, it can be simply seen to follow **LIFO**(Last In First Out)/**FILO**(First In Last Out) order._<br>

_The advanatges of **Stacks** are it provides a way for users to access different pieces of contiguous data in a Last In First Out manner. Stacks are easy to use and gurantee O(1) runtime for these 3 operations(E-Peek, E-Pop, E-Element)._

## Queues

_Queues is a **Linear Data Structure** which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out **(FIFO)**. A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first (Starbucks). The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added._

_The advantages are: it can basically have infinite length compared with the use of fixed-length arrays. It is fast and flexible . It can handle multiple data types. A queue allows for O(1) insertion from the end and O(1)deletion from the front._
