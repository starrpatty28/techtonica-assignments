// Independent Practie

// Runtime Complexity Exercise 1: Reading code and analyzing runtime

// Read the functions in runtime1-analyzing.js. For each function, figure out:

// What does the function do?
// What is the input size? Examples include the size of a list, the length of a string, or the integer passed into a function. This will be "n" in Big O notation.
// Try to figure out the runtime -- O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), or O(2^n)
// When the input size doubles, what would happen to the time it takes to run?
