//Loops

//ForLoops
    // We use ForLoops when we want to execute a chunk of code a certain amount of times

    // for (let I = 0; I < 10; I++)

    // 1. for (let i = 0,   First we initialize the counter variable
    // 2. i < 10;   The loop will run each time the condition is true (as long as I is less than 10, this loop will keep running
    // 3. I++  This is stating to add 1 to the vale of the variable each time it goes around

    // “For each iteration, beginning with i = 0, run this code if i is less than 10, incrementing i by 1”
